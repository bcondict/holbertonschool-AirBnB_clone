## Details

For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:

* [Python packages](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/66) 

* [AirBnB clone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/74)

## Background Context

### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

Before starting, please read the  [AirBnB](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/bw70gxOl1RHBKFAWAR2Y3w) 
  concept page.

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the  AirBnB clone .This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration… 
Each task is linked and will help you to:

* put in place a parent class (called  ` BaseModel ` ) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB ( ` User ` ,  ` State ` ,  ` City ` ,  ` Place ` …) that inherit from  ` BaseModel ` 
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. 
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/YeIzIx-J9Sd9WgiVerOpdQ) 
 ,  without the help of Google :

### General

* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the  ` cmd `  module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage  ` datetime ` 
* What is an  ` UUID ` 
* What is  ` *args `  and how to use it
* What is  ` **kwargs `  and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* Allowed editors:  ` vi ` ,  ` vim ` ,  ` emacs ` 
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly  ` #!/usr/bin/python3 ` 
* A  ` README.md `  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using  ` wc ` 
* All your modules should have a documentation ( ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)' ` )
* All your classes should have a documentation ( ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)' ` )
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ( ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' `  and  ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)' ` )
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

* Allowed editors:  ` vi ` ,  ` vim ` ,  ` emacs ` 
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder  ` tests ` 
* You have to use the [unittest module](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/QX7d4D__xhOJIGIWZBp39g) 

* All your test files should be python files (extension:  ` .py ` )
* All your test files and folders should start by  ` test_ ` 
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* e.g., For  ` models/base_model.py ` , unit tests must be in:  ` tests/test_models/test_base_model.py ` 
* e.g., For  ` models/user.py ` , unit tests must be in:  ` tests/test_models/test_user.py ` 
* All your tests should be executed by using this command:  ` python3 -m unittest discover tests ` 
* You can also test file by file by using this command:  ` python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py ` 
* All your modules should have a documentation ( ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)' ` )
* All your classes should have a documentation ( ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)' ` )
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ( ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' `  and  ` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)' ` )
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### GitHub

There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

## More Info

### Execution

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode:   ` $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash `
